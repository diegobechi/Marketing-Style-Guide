					<h3>Support hours</h3>
					<p>We will always aim to respond to your messages within 12 hours, if not sooner! Our office hours are Monday through Friday, 7am to 5pm Pacific. If your email is sent outside those hours, you’ll receive a response when our team gets back into the office.</p>

					<h3>Why we stick to emails</h3>
					<p>Our belief is that email is the best format in which to support any technical product because it allows you to communicate exactly what is going wrong, and for us to take the time to fully troubleshoot your issue without keeping you from doing what you do best: managing your business.</p>

				<div class="rc_informative-page__block">
					<h3>Help us help you</h3>
					<p>
						We want to help, and sending details will save everyone time! Help us help you by including all of the information you can think of in your first message to us. For example: 
						<ul>
							<li>If you are having issues with orders, include the name and email of the customers affected</li>
							<li>If there is a front-end issue, send a screenshot and URL</li>
							<li>If there is a problem with an order flow, include as many details as possible</li>
						</ul>
						We believe in doing what is right for our users. We will work tirelessly to make sure that if your issue is with us, it is resolved; and if it is not we will work with you to point you in the right direction. In return we ask only for your patience while we work together to find a solution.
